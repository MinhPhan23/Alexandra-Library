# Alexandria Library A02-7

## Purpose
An app to read books and maintain the library

## Vision Statement

- ### Alexandria Library Description

Alexandria Library will be used to maintain all libraries and allow readers to have easy access to books, whether it is keeping track of book records, reading books online or borrowing paper books in the libraries if available. Additionally, librarians would be able to organize the books in their library to their liking.

There will be a list of books and articles with their descriptions that every user will be able to look at. Alexandria Library would offer the ability to add books to a user's personal collection. Within this collection, the users can freely organize the books in the most convenient way for them, such as putting the favorite books together, for ease of finding.

Within these books, readers can choose to read the books online if they are available. Otherwise, the system can help readers find paper books in one of the libraries. While reading books on personal devices, it is possible for readers to add in private notes and comments for the content of the books.

- ### Alexandria Library's Target Audience

Due to the diverse libraries in Alexandria, our assorted user base can find many interests, hobbies and bodies of literature to enjoy. The target users for Alexandria Library range from students looking to organize their school textbooks and keep track of reading progress to everyday use cases such as books to read while on the go.

A user of Alexandria is anyone who reads or organizes their texts for themselves or others. If an organization or a business owner wants their library as part of Alexandria, they can do so.

- ### What values does Alexandria Library has?
The use of Alexandria Library is a major improvement over the classic physical library. It grants access to different libraries with various styles and procedures. Readers will be able to find, access and obtain books through personal devices any time, from any library all in the same way. Alexandria also benefits librarians, as they can make changes to the book inventory. Our project will help teenagers, students, or people who struggle planning or organizing books, to develop a reading plan easily.

- ### What success criteria Alexandria Library is?
The library project will be considered successful if 60% of all users find and finish reading a book of their choice and 40% of those users spend 8 hours in Alexandria weekly. The project aims to have 100 registered users in one month after release with 70% of them creating their own book list. It is expected that 10 physical libraries will integrate our system into their online publishing and at least 60% of them prefer Alexandria to alternatives with similar functionality.
