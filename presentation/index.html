          <p class = "vision">Alexandria Library is a library management solution, which allows users to track their progress across entire series of books, as well as assists librarians in managing the catalogue. Alexandria aims to ease the exploration of books for our users and at the same time give vendors a space to reach out to users directly.</p>

          <h3 id = "users_heading">Who is it for?</h3>
          <p class = "vision">Alexandria is the place where book vendors can meet their potential customers by allowing users to familiarize themselves with the catalogue and encourages users to keep reading their favourite books. The ability of a vendor to put forth their catalogue is as easy as registering a librarian account and simply adding the books through Alexandria. For the reader the process is even more simple, only a quick registration and a single search can show you the book you’ve been looking for as well as all related information which can allow users to branch out their search for similar books. Alexandria hopes to foster a community of readers and vendors who can help each other thrive.</p>

          <ul>
            <li class = "features">Users and Librarians can log in using a registered account which keeps track of any additions made to the users lists and the libraries’ catalogue.</li>
            <li class = "features">Users can add and remove books from preset lists to keep track of which books they are reading, have finished or which books they are yet to start.</li>
            <li class = "features">Users can find books by searching either specific tags and genres or by selecting a group of tags/genres to find all books which match.</li>
            <li class = "features">Users can of course find books they want to read, by title they can find exact matches, but if by some chance the book is not present within the library users can browse through every single book in Alexandria to find something they enjoy.</li>
            <li class = "features">Librarians have their own way of interacting with Alexandria, they are given a separate account to ensure that librarians have the tools they need for the maintenance of their catalogue.</li>
            <li class = "features">Librarians can delete books which are no longer appropriate to keep within the library, be it because of copyright or anything else. Librarians can delete books from the entire library and from any lists books have been added into with just a single click.</li>
            <li class = "features">Librarians can add books as well, simply filling out all the required information right in the app and updating the database instantly, any users can add books as soon as they are added meaning that new additions can be put on the users radar nearly instantaneously.</li>

            <dt class="retro_questions">WHAT WENT RIGHT IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</dt>
            <dd class="retro_answers">There were multiple things that went right with our development process. There was a clear improvement within our group in every area from iteration to iteration. The biggest improvement came from our communication. There was a big improvement in our communication as stated in our Iteration 2 retrospective, where our constant meetings improved our workflow. This continued over to Iteration 3, where we held consistent meetings on how to approach our development. Our biggest concern heading into the final iteration was the amount of bugs remaining in our project, due to time restrictions met in Iteration 2. Our planning ahead and thorough communication allowed us to identify such bugs and ensure that our final product was working properly.</dd>
            <dt class="retro_questions">WHAT WENT WRONG IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</dt>
            <dd class="retro_answers">We were not able to implement as many features as we originally planned in iteration 0. This was caused by multiple issues. Our inexperience with Android Studio hampered our progress multiple times, causing issues with emulation and faulty system tests. We also underestimated the amount of time it would take to create tests for our project. Of course, we learned the importance of writing tests, but we had to make sure that such tests were written thoroughly and effectively, at the cost of development time. A significant amount of time was also spent on bugfixing and resolving technical debt. Overall, we believe that time management hampered our project the most. Towards the end, we learned to manage our time with consistent team meetings and proper use of the GitLab features.</dd>
            <dt class="retro_questions">WHAT DID WE LEARN ABOUT TEAM OR LARGE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT?</dt>
            <dd class="retro_answers">Participating in a large team project showed the importance of learning from mistakes and evolving our practices. Despite encountering various challenges such as underestimating time constraints and searching for bugfixes, each setback served as a catalyst for improvement. Through each iteration, we embraced a system of continuous learning and adaptation, honed our strategies and ultimately delivered a more refined product. This experience reaffirmed the value of open communication, collaboration, and adaptability in navigating complex projects. We learned that it is okay to make mistakes, since it allows us to improve ourselves for future projects. Moving forward, we learned to leverage these lessons to drive our projects towards success.</dd>

          <li>Carlo Garcia</li>
          <p class="insights">I learned the importance of communication in a group project. Since everyone in the project was in the learning process, it was essential that everyone communicate with one another to ask for help, express concerns of bugs and issues, and give/receive feedback. I found that we were able to make more progress the more often we meet and discuss issues and tasks with our project.</p>
          <li>Alina Ivanichsheva</li>
          <p class="insights">I learned how important communication is during group work, and how difficult it is to predict the exact time spent on project work. I also became familiar with the github workflow which will be useful for my future work and studies.</p>
          <li>Hoang Phan</li>
          <p class="insights">Through the project, I learned a lot of development skills both conceptual and technical. My main takeaway from the project is the agile practice and test driven development, changing both the way I approach development and maintaining the Git repository. I also found testing a very tedious yet important process that ensure the project will not break apart after every merge commit. Learning how to use JUnit testing framework would also benefit me for the first work term.</p>
          <li>Xiang Shi</li>
          <p class="insights">From this project, I'm learned a lot about how to organize a project which is gaining skills in managing software projects, including estimating timelines, managing resources. Second, I understand how to design, implement, and manage databases, including knowledge of HSQLDB databases. Third, I know how project's architecture should be. Fourth, we can by using gitlab to contribute our project.  fifth, I know how to testing our program by writting unit test, integration test and system test.</p>
          <li>Andrei Sholokhov</li>
          <p class="insights">I've learned how to use git for my workflow, familiarizing myself with branching merging and resolving conflicts. This project is a tiered application, working on the presentation and data layers taught me how to organize an application into layers and showed me how intricate the presentation layer can be.</p>
